### Running Multiple Bridges

To use this plugin with more than one Tedee bridge, add one platform block per bridge to your `config.json` and make sure each one has:

* a unique `name`
* a unique `webhookPort` (otherwise the second instance will fail with `EADDRINUSE`)
* an explicit `bridgeIp` (auto-discovery may otherwise pick the same bridge for both instances)

```json
{
  "platforms": [
    {
      "platform": "TedeeBridge",
      "name": "Tedee Home",
      "apiKey": "API-KEY-1",
      "bridgeIp": "192.168.0.20",
      "webhookPort": 3003
    },
    {
      "platform": "TedeeBridge",
      "name": "Tedee Office",
      "apiKey": "API-KEY-2",
      "bridgeIp": "192.168.0.21",

### API Key

To obtain the API key, you need to log in to the Tedee app and navigate to the settings of your bridge.
There you will find the API key.
![Selecting API Token type](https://docs.tedee.com/howtos/images/token_plain.png "Selecting API Token type")

Bear in mind there are **two types** of Authentication Tokens:

1. **Encrypted** - This must be selected for the plugin to work!
2. **Plain** - unsecured, which must be used <span style="color:red">**for development purposes only!**</span> and never
   in production environment.

More information can be found in the [Tedee API documentation](https://docs.tedee.com/bridge-api#tag/Authenticate).

## Usage

* When you change the HomeKit switch to locked, the smart lock with lock the door.
* When you change the HomeKit switch from locked to unlocked, the smart door will unlock the door. If you have "auto
  pull spring" enabled in the Tedee app, it will also unlatch.
* When you change the HomeKit switch from unlocked to unlocked, you have the unlatching enabled ("pull spring" in the
  Tedee app) then the lock will unlatch.
